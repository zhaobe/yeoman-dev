# yeoman-dev
Exploration into yeoman and its capabilities

## Setup
- make sure you have node and npm installed.
- `npm install --global yo` to install yeoman globally on local machine.
- `npm install --global gulp-cli bower generator-webapp` to install gulp-cli, bower, and the webapp generator.
- `yo webapp` will guide you to the yeoman interface to create your webapp structure now.
- installed the defaults, chose Bootstrap 3, and TDD for DSL style.
- had to override the .gitignore file due to conflict, then yeoman should be handling the npm install and bower installs.
